```sql
users (
    id, name, email, password, phone, address, avatar,
    user_type ENUM('individual', 'business', 'vendor', 'admin'),
    business_name, business_address, business_phone,
    vendor_status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'suspended'),

    verified_at, approved_at, rejected_at,
    created_at, updated_at
)
```

### Products Table
```sql
products (
    id, category_id, vendor_id, name, slug, description,
    specifications JSON, price_per_day, vendor_price,
    stock, image, gallery JSON, status,
    listing_status ENUM('draft', 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'),

```

## 🔄 Status Workflows

### Product Listing Workflow
```
Vendor Creates → Pending Review → Admin Approval → Live on Platform
     ↓               ↓               ↓               ↓
   draft          pending        approved         active
```

### Rental Approval Workflow

**Platform Products:**
```
Customer Books → Admin Approves → Admin Activates → Admin Completes
     ↓               ↓               ↓               ↓
  pending        approved         active        completed
  (stock=5)      (stock=5)       (stock=4)     (stock=5)
```

**Vendor Products:**
```
Customer Books → Vendor Approves/Activates → Vendor Completes
     ↓               ↓                           ↓
  pending          active                   completed
  (stock=3)       (stock=2)                (stock=3)
```

### Stock Management
- **Stock decreases (-1)** when rental status changes to `active`
- **Stock increases (+1)** when rental status changes to `completed` or `cancelled` (from active)
- **Automatic validation** ensures stock availability before activation
